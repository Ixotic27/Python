    "## 2. Purpose\n",

    "## **CUSTOM ERROR HANDLING**\n",
    "Custom exception errors in Python are **user-defined classes** that inherit from Python's built-in `Exception` class (or one of its subclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What They Are and Why We Use Them\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Specificity and Clarity:** Built-in exceptions like `ValueError` or `TypeError` are often too general. By creating a custom exception (e.g., `NegativeNumberError`, `InsufficientFundsError`), you provide a **clear, domain-specific name** for the problem. This makes the code much easier to read and understand.\n",
    "2.  **Graceful Handling:** They allow you to **catch and handle specific errors** without accidentally catching other, unrelated errors. When you use a `try...except` block, you can target your custom error precisely, letting other unexpected exceptions propagate normally.\n",
    "3.  **Encapsulation of Detail:** Custom exceptions can hold specific data about the error (like the offending value, a user ID, or a transaction amount) by adding attributes to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How They Work (The Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom exception is simply a class definition. The most basic form looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Inheritance:** It must inherit from the base `Exception` class: `class MyCustomError(Exception):`. This makes it behave like a standard exception that can be raised and caught.\n",
    "2.  **Raising:** You trigger the error using the `raise` keyword:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    raise MyCustomError(\"This is the custom error message.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Catching:** You handle the error in a `try...except` block:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code that might raise MyCustomError\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    except MyCustomError as e:\n",
    "        # Handle only this specific error\n",
    "        print(f\"Caught the custom error: {e}\")\n",
    "    ```"
