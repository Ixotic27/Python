    "## 1. Pandas\n",
    "* **What it is:** The primary library for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "* **Core Concept:** It provides a powerful, two-dimensional data structure called the **DataFrame**, \n",
    "    which is essentially a flexible table (like a spreadsheet or a SQL table) you can program with.\n",
    "* **Use for:** Reading and writing data (from CSV, Excel, SQL databases, etc.), cleaning messy data, \n",
    "    filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, and reshaping data.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Numpy (Numerical Python) 🔢\n",
    "* **What it is:** The fundamental library for numerical and scientific computing.\n",
    "* **Core Concept:** It provides a highly efficient array object called the **ndarray** (N-dimensional array). \n",
    "    This allows for fast, vectorized mathematical operations on large sets of numbers, which is \n",
    "    much faster than using standard Python lists.\n",
    "* **Use for:** Linear algebra, statistical operations, random number generation, and any heavy-duty math. \n",
    "    Pandas is built directly on top of NumPy; the columns in a Pandas DataFrame are often NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Matplotlib 📊\n",
    "* **What it is:** The original and most widely used data visualization library.\n",
    "* **Core Concept:** It's a low-level, highly customizable \"plotting engine.\" It gives you \n",
    "    fine-grained control over every single element of your charts (like axes, labels, colors, and layout).\n",
    "* **Use for:** Creating all standard types of static plots: line charts, bar charts, histograms, \n",
    "    scatter plots, etc. It's the foundation for many other plotting libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Seaborn 🎨\n",
    "* **What it is:** A high-level statistical data visualization library *based on* Matplotlib.\n",
    "* **Core Concept:** Seaborn is a \"wrapper\" for Matplotlib. It simplifies the process of creating complex, \n",
    "    common statistical plots and makes them look much more modern and attractive by default.\n",
    "* **Use for:** Creating beautiful heatmaps, pair plots, violin plots, and regression plots. \n",
    "    It integrates perfectly with Pandas DataFrames, letting you create complex visualizations \n",
    "    with just one or two lines of code."
