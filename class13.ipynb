    "# *Abstract Classes:*\n",
    "An abstract class is a special type of class in object-oriented programming that acts as a blueprint for other classes. It cannot be used to create an object directly (you can't \"instantiate\" it). Instead, it's designed to be inherited by other classes, which are called concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a fill-in-the-blanks template: it provides a common structure and can define some methods, but it leaves other specific methods undefined for the child classes to fill in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# *Key Features:*<br>\n",
    "1. Cannot Be Instantiated: You cannot create a direct object from an abstract class. For example, if you have an abstract class Shape, you can't just make a new Shape(). You must create a concrete class that inherits from it, like a Circle or Square.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Contains Abstract Methods: These are methods that are declared but have no implementation (no code inside). They act as a contract, forcing any child class to provide its own specific version of that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For example, an abstract Shape class might have an abstract method called calculateArea(). The Shape class itself doesn't know how to calculate the area, but it knows that every specific shape (like Circle or Rectangle) must know how to calculate its own area.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can Contain Concrete Methods: An abstract class can also have regular methods with full implementations. This is its biggest advantage. These methods are shared by all child classes, which helps to reduce code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For example, the abstract Shape class could have a concrete method called getColor() that stores and returns the shape's color. Since this logic is the same for all shapes, it can be written once in the abstract parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Use an Abstract Class?<br>\n",
    "The main purpose of an abstract class is to enforce a common structure and share common code among several related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Enforce a Contract: It guarantees that any class inheriting from it will have certain methods (the abstract ones). This makes your program more predictable and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Share Common Code: It allows you to write common functionality in one place (the concrete methods). If you need to change that shared logic, you only have to change it in the abstract class, not in every single child class."
